            <p id="para">Sushant Singh Rajput was born in Patna in the state of Bihar to Krishna Kumar Singh and Usha Singh.His father is a retired technical officer and worked at Bihar State Handloom Corporation in Patna.He was the youngest of five siblings and had the nickname Gulshan.One of his four sisters Mitu Singh was a state-level cricket player.He attended the St. Karen's High School in Patna.His family moved to Delhi following his mother's death in 2002 where Rajput completed his schooling for intermediate studies in Kulachi Hansraj Model School.

                Rajput was reportedly an avid reader who was deeply interested in astrophysics and won the National Olympiad in Physics.He secured admission in the Delhi College of Engineering (later renamed Delhi Technological University) to pursue a Bachelor of Engineering degree in mechanical engineering.According to Rajput, he did not have any interest in engineering but his family gave him no option which left him dissatisfied. He instead wanted to become an astronaut and later an air force pilot but was also interested in Bollywood, being a fan of Shah Rukh Khan.</p>
        
            <p id="early-career">Early Career And Television</p>
                <p id="para">During his course at the Delhi College of Engineering, Rajput enrolled himself in Shiamak Davar's dance classes.Soon afterward, he also began attending acting classes under the theatre director Barry John.Rajput later stated that he found the experience to be liberating and wanted to continue doing it forever.He featured as a background dancer in the Dhoom Again song of Dhoom 2 and in Aishwarya Rai's performance at the closing ceremony of the 2006 Commonwealth Games.In 2006, he dropped out of his engineering course during his fourth year to begin a career in arts and performance.He moved to Mumbai, took up odd jobs and small roles alongside working in the theatre industry.Rajput eventually joined Nadira Babbar's theatre group called the Ekjute in which he remained for two and a half years.
                
                He was spotted by a casting team of Balaji Telefilms while he was working at the Prithvi Theatre.Rajput was subsequently called for an audition and cast as a second lead in the television series Kis Desh Mein Hai Meraa Dil in 2008.He had secured the role of Preet Singh Juneja, the stepbrother of the lead named Harshad Chopda and entered the show in its seventh episode.The character was killed early in the show, but due to popularity among viewers was brought back in the series finale as a spirit looking on as his family celebrated coming out of difficult times.The performance had made an impression on the producer Ekta Kapoor who vouched for him to be cast as the lead in another series Pavitra Rishta,reportedly against the wishes of the hosting channel, Zee TV.
                
                In Pavitra Rishta, Rajput was cast as Manav Deshmukh who was an "ideal son and husband" and co-starred along with Ankita Lokhande.The role was reportedly a breakthrough for him and for which he won various television awards,including his first award for best actor in the Indian Television Academy Awards 2010.He also won three major television awards in the categories of best male actor and most popular actor.In 2010, he joined the dance reality show Zara Nachke Dikha in its second season as part of the Mast Kalandar Boys team.On the Mother's Day special episode, the team dedicated a performance to Rajput's mother who had died.Later in the same year, he also took part in the fourth season of another dance competition reality show called Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa and was paired alongside the choreographer Shampa Sonthalia; they emerged as the runners-up of the season.
                
                Rajput continued to act in Pavitra Rishta from its first airing in 2009 till his exit in 2011,having played the part of the protagonist of the series for two and a half years at the time of his exit.He had stated that he intended to move to the United States to study filmmaking and had already gained experience behind the scenes in the film Raaz 2,where he was an assistant director.Rajput made a later reappearance in the final episode of Pavitra Rishta in 2014 after gaining critical acclaim in Bollywood.</p>

            <p id="para">Rajput's personal relationships have been the subject of widespread media attention.In 2011, Rajput publicly proposed to his Pavitra Rishta co-star Ankita Lokhande during a national broadcast of the dance competition show Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa, both of them had participated in the show as competing contestants.The couple began dating after their first meeting on the set of Pavitra Rishta, where they had been cast as husband and wife to each other.In 2012, they began living together,and reports of an imminent marriage between the two occasionally cropped up in the media.In an interview, Rajput stated that marriage and cohabitation were no different and that it was hypocritical to treat the former as sacred and the latter as a crime.At an event, he had said, "I am very transparent about my relationships. I mean I will not hesitate to say that I am in a relationship".

                In 2014, rumours that they were already secretly married due to family pressure were denied by the couple.In January 2016, Rajput confirmed that a lavish wedding would take place in December,but the relationship ended prior to that, with the pair maintaining silence on the reasons for the cancellation.In a 2021 interview, Lokhande said that Rajput wanted to go ahead in his career and they ended their relationship mutually.
                
                After the breakup, Rajput's relationship status became the subject of speculation and gossip.He was rumored to be dating his Raabta co-star Kriti Sanon which was denied by both of them.In 2017, Rajput courted controversy when he came out in support of the producers of Padmaavat whose sets were vandalised by members of the Rajput Karni Sena.That same year, he became the co-owner of Delhi Gladiators, a team in the Super Boxing League.In preparation for his role in Chanda Mama Door Ke, he was given the opportunity to train at NASA where he intended to go back and complete his instructor training, aspiring to be chosen for the 2024 Artemis program. Retaining his interest in astronomy and astrophysics, he purchased the high end Meade LX-600 16" telescope for stargazing purposes.He also had a collection of 125 books including a six-volume theoretical physics series. Rajput stated in an August 2017 interview that his collection was not for film research, but covered personal interests in multiple disciplines, including cognitive science and behavioral economics.He was reportedly an avid reader who would bring books during tours for film shooting.
                
                In 2018, he was the subject of another rumour regarding his Kedarnath co-star Sara Ali Khan.The rumours were never confirmed as before the two supposedly broke up, Rajput refused to comment on the claims.Later in the next year, it was reported that he was dating actress Rhea Chakraborty and that they intended to keep the matter private.When questioned, he reportedly unwittingly confirmed the relationship by stating that if interviewers asked questions that were only about him, he could answer at his own discretion but he would also have to ask "somebody" before confirming any details.Chakraborty and Rajput were occasionally spotted on "dates" and outings in Mumbai,and on a vacation to the Himalayan region of Ladakh.
                
                After Rajput's death, Chakraborty confirmed that she was his girlfriend and that he would refuse medication, relying instead on yoga and meditation.According to Rajput's father, the actor mentioned his plans to marry in 2021 but did not reveal his intended bride; Ankita Lokhande was the only girlfriend that his father had known about.</p>

            <p id="death">Death</p>
            <p id="para">On 14 June 2020, Rajput, aged 34, was found dead, hanging from the ceiling fan in his home in Bandra, Mumbai.He had reportedly shown signs of clinical depression and had bipolar disorder.The Mumbai Police commenced an investigation, stating that the death was being treated as a suicide.The postmortem report stated that the cause of death was "asphyxia due to hanging,"and called it a "clear case of suicide."The autopsy doctors placed the time of death at 10 to 12 hours before postmortem examination on 14 June at 11:30 p.m.â€”meaning between 11:30 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. (Indian Standard Time).No foul play was found.The viscera report likewise ruled out foul play.On 25 July, Rajput's family lodged a first information report with police in Patna, where his father lives, accusing Rhea Chakraborty and five others of abetment of suicide.

                On 31 July, Enforcement Directorate (ED) filed a case to investigate the money laundering of Rajput's money from his bank accounts by Chakraborty, her parents and associates.On 19 August 2020, the Supreme Court of India allowed the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), the Indian national government's top investigating agency, to take control of the investigation and ordered the CBI to look into any future cases registered in relation to Rajput's death.Later, the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) also filed a case to investigate drug peddling, based on phone chats forwarded to it by ED during its investigation.
                
                On 8 September, Rhea Chakraborty was arrested by the NCB in a drug case linked to the investigation of the death probe. Prior to the arrest, 9 others were arrested by the NCB in the drug case including Rhea's brother, Showik Chakraborty.On 12 July 2022, the NCB filed draft charges against 35 people, including Rhea Chakraborty and her brother. The NCB claimed that Rajput had been using numerous people to obtain drugs since 2018 and accused his flatmate Pithani and others of "aiding and abetting" Rajput to "extreme drug addiction."
                
                On 7 September, Chakraborty filed an FIR against the late actor's sisters, claiming they had supplied him psychotrophic anti-depressants without proper medical consultation and using a forged prescription.She requested an investigation into whether these had resulted in his suicide or a decline in his mental state.The following month, Rajput's sisters asked the High Court to cancel the FIR.The Bombay High Court agreed to invalidate the FIR against his sister Meetu but upheld the FIR against his sister Priyanka, stating that there was "prima facie evidence" against her.The Supreme Court also rejected an appeal filed by Priyanka Singh and the filing was handed to the CBI to investigate.
                
                On 3 October, Dr. Sudhir Gupta of All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, leader of a forensic medical team tasked by CBI for assistance, said, "Sushant death is a case of suicide. Murder completely ruled out."Gupta told Asian News International (ANI), "There were no injuries over the body other than hanging. There were no marks of struggle or scuffle in the body and clothes of the deceased."On 5 October, ANI reported that the AIIMS medical board had submitted its report to CBI confirming that Rajput died by suicide and ruling out murder.On 15 October 2020, the CBI said it "continues to investigate the death of Rajput. There are certain speculative reports in the media that the CBI has reached a conclusion. It may be reiterated that these reports are speculative and erroneous."</p>
